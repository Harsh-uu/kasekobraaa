# Production Deployment Testing Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide for testing the application in production after deploying the authentication and image handling fixes.

## Before You Begin

1. Ensure all changes have been committed and pushed to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix authentication issues and improve error handling"
   git push
   ```

2. Deploy the application to your production environment using your preferred method (Vercel, AWS, etc.)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Authentication Flow Testing

1. **New User Registration Test**
   - Open an incognito/private browser window
   - Navigate to your production site
   - Click "Sign Up" or equivalent button
   - Complete the registration process
   - Verify you are properly authenticated and redirected to the dashboard

2. **Existing User Login Test**
   - Open another incognito/private browser window
   - Navigate to your production site
   - Click "Log In" or equivalent button
   - Enter credentials for an existing user
   - Verify you are properly authenticated and redirected appropriately
   - Confirm no "Log in to continue" message appears after successful authentication

3. **Auth-Callback Redirect Test**
   - After login, check the network tab in browser developer tools
   - Verify that the auth-callback route functions correctly
   - No infinite redirects should occur
   - The console should be free of authentication-related errors

### 2. Image Upload & Processing Testing

1. **Image Upload Test**
   - Navigate to the upload page (`/configure/upload`)
   - Upload a new image
   - Verify the upload completes successfully
   - Check the network tab for any errors related to UploadThing API calls
   - Confirm you are redirected to the design page with your image

2. **Image Manipulation Test**
   - On the design page, manipulate the image (resize, position, etc.)
   - Verify the image displays correctly with no CORS errors
   - Check the browser console for any image loading errors

3. **Design Configuration Test**
   - Select different case options (color, material, finish, model)
   - Click the "Continue" button
   - Verify you are redirected to the preview page
   - Check that your configuration is saved correctly

### 3. Diagnostics Testing

1. **Visit the Diagnostics Page**
   - Navigate to `/diagnostics`
   - Test image loading with a URL from your application
   - Check authentication status
   - Verify system information is correctly displayed

2. **API Diagnostics**
   - Navigate to `/api/diagnostics`
   - Verify the API returns the correct authentication status
   - Check for any errors in the response

### 4. Error Recovery Testing

1. **Intentional Error Test**
   - Try accessing a protected route without authentication
   - Verify you are redirected to login
   - After login, check you're redirected back to the original page

2. **Invalid Image Test**
   - Try uploading an invalid image or manipulating the URL
   - Verify appropriate error handling is in place
   - Check that the application doesn't crash

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Issues

- **Redirect Loop**: Check the middleware.ts configuration and ensure auth routes are properly excluded
- **Not Authenticated After Login**: Verify the KindeProvider is properly set up in Providers.tsx
- **API Authentication Failures**: Check if middleware is correctly bypassing auth for API routes

### Image Loading Issues

- **CORS Errors**: Use the image-utils.ts utilities to handle CORS
- **Broken Images**: Check if the UTImage component is being used correctly
- **Image Processing Failures**: Verify the canvas operations in DesignConfigurator.tsx

### Application Flow Issues

- **Redirects Not Working**: Check that the router navigation in client components is functioning
- **Database Updates Failing**: Verify that the database operations are separated from image processing
- **UI Inconsistencies**: Test across different browsers and devices
