# Production Deployment Checklist

## Before Deployment
- [x] Verify KindeProvider is correctly added to Providers.tsx
- [x] Ensure middleware.ts properly excludes auth routes and API endpoints
- [x] Confirm UploadThing integration works correctly
- [x] Verify error handling is improved in the design configurator
- [x] Check that the auth-callback page includes improved error handling

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit all changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix authentication issues and improve error handling"
   git push
   ```

2. Deploy to production (using your preferred platform)

## Post-Deployment Verification Tests

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Test signup flow for a new user
- [ ] Verify login with existing user
- [ ] Confirm no "Log in to continue" message appears after successful auth
- [ ] Check auth-callback redirects correctly to the design page

### UploadThing Integration
- [ ] Upload an image and verify it processes correctly
- [ ] Confirm no CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Verify uploaded images display properly in the design configurator

### Design Flow
- [ ] Complete the design process from start to finish
- [ ] Press Continue button on design page and verify it redirects properly
- [ ] Check that the preview page shows the correct configuration
- [ ] Verify no redirect loops occur anywhere in the flow

### Image Handling
- [ ] Test image loading in both design and preview pages
- [ ] Verify UTImage component correctly handles UploadThing images
- [ ] Check browser console for any image-related errors

## Troubleshooting Steps (if needed)
1. Check server logs for any errors
2. Look for browser console errors related to authentication or image loading
3. Verify Kinde authentication is working properly
4. Test middleware.ts by accessing protected paths directly
5. Visit the diagnostics page (/diagnostics) to debug any image loading issues
