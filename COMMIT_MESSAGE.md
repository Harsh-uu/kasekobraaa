# Authentication and Image Handling Fixes

This commit fixes multiple authentication and image handling issues:

## Authentication Fixes
- Added KindeProvider to client-side Providers component
- Updated middleware configuration to bypass auth for:
  - UploadThing API routes
  - Webhook endpoints
  - Kinde authentication callback paths
- Improved error handling in auth-callback page
- Fixed redirect issues by updating middleware matcher config

## Image Handling Improvements
- Added better error handling for image loading
- Added timeout handling for image processing
- Added proper CORS handling for images
- Improved error reporting in DesignConfigurator

## Diagnostics and Testing
- Added diagnostics API endpoint for troubleshooting
- Created comprehensive diagnostics page with tabs for:
  - Image testing
  - Authentication status
  - System information
- Added deployment checklist and production testing guide

## Development Utilities
- Added logger utility for consistent logging
- Added image utility functions for preloading and CORS handling
- Added Tabs component for the diagnostics UI

These changes should resolve the authentication issues in production and improve the overall robustness of the application.
